MammothSteppe uses the Empirical framework to simulate the mammoth steppe ecosystem, a massive and productive biome that existed at the end of the last glacial maximum. The world contains mammoths, grass, and trees. Grass and trees grow by photosynthesis, but the grass reproduces much faster. The mammoths eat grass to avoid starvation and reproduce. They also trample trees, preserving the mammoth steppe by stopping the encroachment of forests and maintaining room for grasslands. The project uses Emscripten to display the world on to a HTML page.
